As I do every year at this time, this week's and next week's issues will take a look back at the tools you clicked the most in this newsletter. In total, I'll go over the **60 most-clicked tools – 30 this week and 30 next week.**

The basis for determining what's 'most clicked' is slightly different than just 'most clicked'. Firstly, I only go with MailChimp's unique clicks in email opens only (no web clicks get counted). Also, some issues have many more 'opens' than others. I calculate the click value by comparing the number of unique clicks to the number of unique opens for that issue. I think this provides a much better overall view of what were the hottest tools.

As an example, a tool that was clicked 200 times in an issue that was opened by 4,200 people would be a click rate of 0.048. On the other hand, a tool that was clicked 180 times in an issue opened by 3,500 would be 0.051, even though it had fewer clicks. So that latter tool would appear higher in the list.

In case you were wondering, **the most unique clicks for a single tool in 2021 was 293** – and you'll find out next week what tool that was!

Thanks to everyone who stuck around through this year, I appreciate your support. Near the bottom of this issue, I've included links to web development courses by Wes Bos, all currently discounted. You can support this newsletter by using those links to purchase a course. Now on to the top tools of 2021 (part 1)!

I mean, isn't this more or less how Chrome became so dominant, through this kind of over-the-top marketing by Google?
