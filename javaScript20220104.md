1.  ‚Äî Back in June of this year, the Ecma General Assembly [approved ES2021](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/117998/086a345ab2). Work continues with [ECMAScript 2022 already having a draft spec](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/117999/086a345ab2). But this post flying through what's new in ES2021 (not a lot!) was *by far* our most popular link of the year, amazingly.

4.  ‚Äî It‚Äôs an opinion but the (still) growing evidence is compelling. Rust (as well as Go) is now being heavily used to replace parts of the JavaScript tooling ecosystem that might have otherwise been written in JS before (e.g. Rome, SWC, dprint).LEE ROBINSON

5.  ‚Äî The web is single-threaded, but two years ago Surma told us [why to always use Web Workers](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118005/086a345ab2) and why to bring multithreading to your solutions despite the difficulties. [Almost every client supports](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118006/086a345ab2) them now, so Surma made the case again.SURMA

6. [Rethinking JavaScript's Ternary Operator](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118007/086a345ab2) ‚Äî `ternary ? "yes" : "no"` ‚Ä¶ A lot of developers regard the ternary operator ‚Äúwith suspicion‚Äù, says James. Does its brevity warrant its use alone? Is it something you can ‚Äútrust‚Äù?
